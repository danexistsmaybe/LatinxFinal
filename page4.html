		I find Macharia's use of frottage to be very compelling, and I wish to extend it to the other meaning of the word. Of course, Macharia is mainly concerned with the sexual, particularly homosexual, signification, but this use of the word came from the art form of frottage for a reason. They are both exciting for the same reasons. Rubbing the shape of a surface onto a page or a canvas is exciting because the page, contrary to its typical function, now obscures and transforms, and through this process something new, some unexpected texture, is produced. Similarly, rubbing the shape of a body, known or unknown, onto one’s own through the obfuscation of clothing is suggestive and exciting. Following the method of Macharia, I would like to apply this unique form of transmission to a question that Fanon leaves terribly unanswered, to see if, perhaps, what Fanon is missing lies in the grasp of the homosexual Latin American.

		Within <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i>, Chapter Five, “The Fact of Blackness,” stands out as particularly experimental, with a narrative style that is as beautiful and devastating as it is cogent. Therein is expressed the emotional state of a person of color in colonial modernity: it is a state that ricochets violently. The chapter ends with Fanon crying out,

	<span class="prose quote">
		Yesterday, awakening to the world, I saw the sky turn upon itself utterly and wholly. I wanted to rise, but the disemboweled silence fell back upon me, its wings paralyzed. Without responsibility, straddling Nothingness and Infinity, I began to weep (140).

	<span class="prose">
		Fanon leaves the reader with several open questions. What sort of paradox is this? Is it a dialectic? What makes it so terrible? Most importantly, what is to be done?

		Earlier on, Fanon appears to find pride in his African heritage, saying,

	<span class="quote prose">
		All of that, exhumed from the past, spread with its insides out, made it possible for me to find a valid historic place. The white man was wrong, I was not a primitive, not even a half-man, I belonged to a race that had already been working in gold and silver two thousand years ago (131).

	<span class="prose">
		Yet, he goes on to quote Sartre, who says that the black man will end his struggle by uniting with the global proletariat: by being subsumed into class struggle. Fanon responds,

	<span class="prose quote">
		"While I was shouting that, in the paroxysm of my being and my fury, [Sartre] was reminding me that my blackness was only a minor term. In all truth, in all truth I tell you, my shoulders slipped out of the framework of the world, my feet could no longer feel the touch of the ground. Without a Negro past, without a Negro future, it was impossible for me to live my Negrohood (138).
	</span>

	<span class="prose">
		By my reading, this is nothingness and infinity. Nothingness is the erasure of the race problem through revolution and materialist analysis, while infinity is the black movement above all else. It is short-sighted, in a sense, but absolutely necessary, as absolutely necessary as nothingness.

	<span class="display-3 prose underscore">Opacity</span>
	<span class="prose">
		Later on, Fanon will describe the phobogenic black man as overdetermined. Perhaps he would benefit from the frottage-like opacity illustrated by Justin Torres in his novel, We The Animals. In that book, notions of race and sexuality are rarely mentioned outright—rarely determined—yet leave their imprint in every chapter. Key features manifest themselves through the uneven terrain of a Puerto Riccan father that is all machismo yet vulnerably sensitive, a family that shows its love adjacent to its physical abuse, and a home whose residents dance, fight, make love, alienate, and wonder all at once. Sometimes these features are expected, like an invitation to Mambo in the kitchen, while at other times what manifests through the opaque page is of a surprising texture, like a father who is proud of having a pretty son.

	<span class="prose">
		To be queer is to be opaque, to be strange, to demand others to rub against myself if they want to learn, and even then it is not clear what they will find through the folds and creases of the things I wear around me. To reach for a utopian future where proximity is the only way to determine anything about a human being: that is the dream of the homosexual. And, perhaps this is process is not so familiar to Fanon; towards the end of Black Skin, White Masks, he says,

		Why not the quite simple attempt to touch the other, to feel the other, to explain the other to myself? Was my freedom not given to me then in order to build the world of the You (232)?
