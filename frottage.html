	<span class="display-3 prose">Interpreting Sexuality in Fanon is Essential for Queer Studies</span>
	<br>
	<span class="display-4 prose underscore">Justification</span>
	<span class="prose">
		By refusing to engage with Fanon and instead relegating the foundations of the topic of sexuality to specified, often white authors—Foucault, for example—scholars of queerness have separated themselves from the topic of race and any intersection it may have with sexuality. This is limiting because, intuitively, race is sexual: the sex tourism industry in the Caribbean is a simple example of this, one that Fanon might have written a book about if he had lived a little later on. In fact, he was one of the first to mention it at all, declaring that the islands were becoming “the brothel of Europe.” In <i>Sexing the Caribbean: Gender, Race, and Sexual Labor</i>, Kempadoo articulates how race is capable of reinforcing and reconciling the heterosexuality of both white women and black men; 
	</span>
	<span class="quote prose">
		Through an appeal to hegemonic constructions of Caribbean masculinity, [Caribbean men] keep up appearances and perform their role as the hypersexual, heterosexual black man, acquiring some power and clout through their associations with foreigners (127).
	</span>
	<br>
	<span class="prose">
	Another example of this is given by Saldaña-Portillo in <i>Indian Given</i>, where she performs a gendered reading of the space on the separate frontiers of the United States and Mexico. In regards to the United States, she describes the way in which male-on-male contact, the rubbing of white male settlers with their male construction of indigenous bodies, marks the physical space on the frontier as available. In her own words,
	</span>
	<span class="quote prose">
		The American wilderness is the condition of possibility for colonial and indigenous masculinity, as the male Indian teaches the male colonist how to survive and thrive in the “too strong” environment. Colonial masculinity is achieved through indigenous adroitness in landscape, an adroitness that in turn authors colonial savagery (scalping). The wilderness and masculinity become one in the frontier thesis, as American geography embodies a muscular Indianness (10).
	</span>
	<span class="prose">
		While sexuality is clearly involved in the construction of race, Keguro Macharia argues for the other direction in <i>Frottage: Frictions of Intimacy across the Black Diaspora</i>. It is not simply that race should be included in sexuality studies as an application, but that race is integral for understanding sexuality, and thus picturing sexuality at the roots of critical race theory, within Fanon, is necessary. Perceiving Fanon’s persistent encounters with sexuality as rubbing, supplemented by the concept of frottage, is an appropriate framework with which to approach this task, according to Macharia.

	<span class="display-4 prose underscore">Frottage</span>
	<span class="prose">
		In Chapter Six, Fanon invents the term “negrophobia,” an illusion that is constructed through phylogenic, ontogenic, and sociogenic imagination. This term is not the same as racism, the difference of which Macharia emphasizes as essential for understanding how Fanon’s most overt discussions on homosexuality unfold. “Negrophobia” comes about once the black man has been made into the phobogenic object:
	</span>
	<span class="quote prose">
		The Negro is a phobogenic object, a stimulus to anxiety. From the patient treated by Serieux and Capgras to the girl who confides to me that to go to bed with a Negro would be terrifying to her, one discovers all the stages of what I shall call the Negro-phobogenesis (151).
	</span>
	<span class="prose">
		These stages begin with the black man as the embodiment of sexual subjectivity, as the penis. Citing Fanon, Macharia says,
	</span>
	<span class="prose quote">
		“As regards the black man,” argues Fanon, “everything in fact takes place at the genital level.” The black man is “viewed as a penis symbol,” “represents the biological danger,” incarnates “rape” (“whoever says rape says black man”), “symbolizes the biological,” “represents the (uneducated) sexual instinct,” “embodies genital power out of reach of morals and taboos,” and “is genital” (38).
	</span>
	<br>
	<span class="prose">
		In other words, Macharia notes that Fanon posits a movement of the black man from a representation of sexual instinct to an ontological equivalency with the genital. Thus, it becomes clear that racism differs from “negrophobia” in that racism primarily begets anger on a trajectory to hatred, while the establishment of a phobiogenic object produces fear, in this case, fear of sexual excess, which inspires longing just as much as it does hatred or revulsion. Here, we arrive at one of Fanon’s incomplete and problematic invocations of the homosexual:
	</span>
	<span class="prose quote">
		When I was in military service I had the opportunity to observe the behavior of white women … when they were among Negroes at dances. Most of the time the women made involuntary gestures of flight, of withdrawing … yet the Negroes who asked them to dance would have been utterly unable to commit any act at all against them, even if they had wished to do so. The behavior of these women is clearly understandable from the standpoint of imagination. That is because the Negrophobic woman is in fact nothing but a putative sexual partner—just as the Negrophobic man is a repressed homosexual (156).
	</span>
	<br>
	<span class="prose">
		Like Macharia, I believe it would be fruitless to argue that these words are not misogynistic and homophobic. A feminist critique of this passage easily demonstrates that the women in this scenario are as much victims of patriarchal social systems as the black men are of racial ones: Fanon is a misogynist. Fanon most likely uses “repressed homosexual” as derogatory here: Fanon is homophobic. Yet, Macharia holds “that alongside the insult—rubbing alongside it—is an insight into the libidinal economy that subtends relations between white men and black men, which is haunted by something that might be (mis)named ‘repressed homosexuality’” (43). Moreover, they posit that because being gay is to desire the sexual object, the phallus, to pursue what is sexually instinctive over what society has deigned as appropriate, and, it follows, to be sexually excessive, to imagine “vaginas, penises, breasts, buttocks, hands, arms, feet, stomachs, mouths and tongues in our expressions of not only intimacy, love, and lust, but also and importantly shame, contempt, despair, and hate;” because my sexuality is all of this, it is impossible to imagine myself without going through the black man (43).

	<span class="prose quote">
		Might blackness be the very core of queer desire (43)?
