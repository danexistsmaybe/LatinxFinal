		Incompleteness does not make Frantz Fanon's <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i> any less compelling. This is a foundational, even mythological, text for the academic schools of critical race and postcolonial theory, black power movements in the Americas, and modern leftism across the world, a book that often evokes more than what is written within it, and all contemporary work in these subjects must engage with it one way or another; yet, in this work, Fanon asks many questions without answers. Similarly, throughout Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon touches, even rubs against, subjects that lack a complete representation: this begets the subject of my writing, the homosexual according to Fanon. The modern literary theorist will see, as many already have, that this book is ripe for deconstruction, as it presents the beginning of a transformative thought which can be completed by pulling apart its vacancies, dialectics, and contradictions.  
	</span>
	<br>
	<span class="prose">
		Before embarking on a journey of deconstruction, it is useful to understand the personal and historical context or scope of <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i>, particularly as it occasionally drifts into the medium of ethnography. Fanon himself declares the importance of this; “Since I was born in the Antilles, my observations and my conclusions are valid only for the Antilles,” he says, “at least concerning the black man at home” (Fanon 16). Born in Martinique, Fanon studied clinical psychology at the University of Lyon in France, and this book was derived from a rejected doctoral dissertation that he wrote during his studies there. Later on, he would practice in Algeria at the height of its independence movement, and he would write multiple books, including the pivotal Wretched of the Earth, that work from his participation in that movement. I will be confining myself to race in the Caribbean, however.

		Fanon's phrasing suggests a transformation occurs when the Afro-Carribean man leaves his home, that blackness takes on a new character. How should we understand this relationship? In chapter six, Fanon recalls,

		As a schoolboy, I had many occasions to spend whole hours talking about the supposed customs of the savage Senegalese. In what was said there was a lack of awareness that was at the very least paradoxical. Because the Antillean does not think of himself as a black man; he thinks of himself as an Antillean. The Negro lives in Africa. Subjectively, intellectually, the Antillean conducts himself like a white man. But he is a Negro. That he will learn once he goes to Europe; and when he hears Negroes mentioned he will recognize that the word includes himself as well as the Senegalese (148).

	<span class="prose">
		Thus, the unique form of neurosis that exists in the mind of the black man, Caribbean man is characterized by the assumption, from childhood, that he is one with white culture; that is, he is human. When he leaves for Europe, for France, which to him is the motherland, he is forced to undertake a transition into what is non-human, a deformity. This is characteristic of Fanon’s method, that of the psychoanalysist.

	<span class="display-4 prose underscore">Pyschoanalysis to Psychopathy</span>
	<span class="prose">
		A key feature of Fanon’s work is that it is always diagnostic. This is partly why it leaves so many questions unanswered, as Fanon is often expressly committed to providing the diagnosis before the cure, and, naturally, it is our point of access to a serious reading of homosexuality in his book, although most queer theory up to this point has merely borrowed the method, rather than use its placement as a way into the content of the text. In any event, Fanon’s psychological method was revolutionary for his time, a necessary development because the traditional methods of psychoanalysis were not sufficient to articulate blackness:

		Reacting against the constitutionalist tendency of the late nineteenth century, Freud insisted that the individual factor be taken into account through psychoanalysis. He substituted for a phylogenetic theory the ontogenetic perspective. It will be seen that the black man's alienation is not an individual question. Beside phylogeny and ontogeny stands sociogeny (13). 
	</blockquote>
	<br>
	<span class="prose">
		In order to understand the human mind, Freud transformed evolutionary phylogeny to the more internal, individual evolution of the psyche, which Freud refers to as ontogeny. Taken together, these methods represent psychoanalysis, and Fanon transforms them both by applying sociogeny, the communal evolution of a group, arriving at what he calls psychopathy in Chapter Six. When Fanon begins to use the psychoanalytic language of the phobia, he acknowledges,
	</span>
	<blockquote class="quote prose">
		There has been much talk of psychoanalysis in connection with the Negro. Distrusting the ways in which it might be applied, I have preferred to call this chapter "The Negro and Psychopathology," well aware that Freud and Adler and even the cosmic Jung did not think of the Negro in all their investigations (151). 
	</blockquote>
	<span class="prose">
		This is particularly interesting because the implication of disease, within the pathologic root of psychopathology, more closely resembles the contemporary language of mental illness used today (which, I acknowledge, is riddled with its own problems). This new conception motivates much of his thinking around concepts like “negrophobia” and desire, concepts we will encounter shortly.
